        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This is a recipe for really tasty ribs, but it doesn't work
            every time.  All you can do is your best!
        </p>
        <p>But I believe you can do it!</p>
        <div class="IngredientList"><h3>Ingredients</h3>

            <li>Yellow Mustard</li>

            <li>Rub top and bottom of ribs with generous amount of yellow 
                mustard (<em>don't worry, you can't taste it when they're done</em>)</li>
            <li>Season ribs generously with BBQ rub, patting down when finished</li>
            <li>Let ribs sit for at least 2 hours (preferably over night)(wrap with foil if
                 storing in the fridge)</li>
            <li>Heat smoker or oven to 250 degrees F</li>
            <li>Put ribs on until meat starts to pull back and edges of bones are exposed</li>
            <li>Slather with BBQ sauce and then wrap each rack in foil</li>
            <li>Return to oven or grill and cook for another hour</li>
